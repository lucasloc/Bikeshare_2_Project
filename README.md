### Udacity Project - Bikeshare2 - 23/03/2020

### Project Description
This script uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, the cities of Chicago, New York City, and Washington

It takes the userÂ´s raw inputs to explore data in the .csv file and show data for the user  
 
### Files used
To run this script you will need:

Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda, chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv


### Datasets Info

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

Gender
Birth Year

### Statistics Computed

You will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. In this script will provide the following information:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

2. Popular stations and trip

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

3. Trip duration

total travel time
average travel time

4. User info

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
